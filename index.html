     <h3>Hi and Welcome to My Humble Site. Creativity Begins Here</h3>
    
     <p>My name is Jude. I am new to the Perscholas program. I love to listen to
        good music and watch some good shows. I also really find technology quite 
        fascinating. I really hope to catch up with you some time later
     </p>

      <p>Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, the trade-off they are making to win. Losers, on the other hand, see it as punishment. And that is the difference.
